# **react-unix-terminal**

I want to build a web terminal, not a real one of course, but to simulate one with executable command

Therefore I built it, then I figure it can be published as NPM package

Hence, I published it

### How do I use it?

```ts
import * as React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import Terminal from 'react-unix-terminal';

ReactDOM.render(
    <React.StrictMode>
        <Terminal
            user="guest"
            name="poolofdeath20"
            fontFamily="JetBrains+Mono"
            height="100vh"
        />
    </React.StrictMode>,
    document.getElementById('root'),
);
```

### Will show in web as
